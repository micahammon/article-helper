# English Article Helper ðŸ“–

[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://micahammon.github.io/article-helper/)

An interactive, rule-based tool to help English learners choose the correct article (`a/an`, `the`, or no article). This project is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, translating the logic from Seonaid Beckwith's excellent guide, "'A' and 'The' Explained".

### How It Works

The tool uses a two-pronged approach to determine the correct article:

1.  **Lookup Table:** A direct lookup for nouns with fixed, specific rules (e.g., proper nouns like "the USA", abstract concepts like "music", or systems like "the internet"). This provides an instant, accurate answer for common exceptions.

2.  **Decision Tree:** For all other nouns, the tool guides the user through a series of contextual questions. By asking about specificity, listener knowledge, and the noun's function (e.g., general concept, institution, classification), it follows a logical path to deduce the correct article based on the rules of English grammar.

### How to Use

1.  **Enter a Noun:** Type the noun or phrase you're unsure about into the input box.
2.  **Check Article:** Click the "Check Article" button.
3.  **Answer the Questions:** If your noun doesn't have a fixed rule, the tool will ask you a series of questions. Choose the option that best fits the context of your sentence.
4.  **Get Your Answer:** The tool will provide the recommended article, a clear explanation of the rule, and the relevant section from the source PDF.
