# English Article Helper ðŸ“–

An interactive, rule-based tool to help English learners choose the correct article (`a/an`, `the`, or no article). This project is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, translating the logic from Seonaid Beckwith's excellent guide, "'A' and 'The' Explained".

### How It Works

The tool uses a two-pronged approach to determine the correct article:

1.  **Lookup Table:** A direct lookup for nouns with fixed, specific rules (e.g., proper nouns like "the USA", abstract concepts like "music", or systems like "the internet"). This provides an instant, accurate answer for common exceptions.

    The lookup step automatically normalizes what you typeâ€”trimming extra spaces, ignoring a leading "a/an/the", and removing simple punctuationâ€”so entries such as "the USA" or "an opera" still match the right rule immediately.

2.  **Decision Tree:** For all other nouns, the tool guides the user through a series of contextual questions. By asking about specificity, listener knowledge, and the noun's function (e.g., general concept, institution, classification), it follows a logical path to deduce the correct article based on the rules of English grammar.

Both data sets live in a single machine-readable file, [`rules_data.json`](rules_data.json). The Python logic and the browser UI read from the same source so they always stay in sync.

### How to Use

1.  **Enter a Noun:** Type the noun or phrase you're unsure about into the input box.
2.  **Check Article:** Click the "Check Article" button.
3.  **Answer the Questions:** If your noun doesn't have a fixed rule, the tool will ask you a series of questions. Choose the option that best fits the context of your sentence.
4.  **Get Your Answer:** The tool will provide the recommended article, a clear explanation of the rule, and the relevant section from the source PDF.

### Running Locally

Because the browser app now fetches its rules from `rules_data.json`, you should serve the files over HTTP when running locally.

1.  Clone this repository or download the project files.
2.  From the project directory, start a simple web server: `python -m http.server`
3.  Open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in any modern web browser.

The Tkinter desktop app (`app.py`) reads the same JSON file, so no extra setup is required beyond installing its Python dependencies.
